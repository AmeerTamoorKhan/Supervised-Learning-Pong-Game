# Supervised-Learning-Pong-Game
Trained the agent through supervised learning to play a pong game.

Machine learning is fun to learn when you put it to some interesting applications. ❤️

The goal is simple, not letting the ball pass the paddle. After providing a bunch of training data, the system learns to play the game on its own.
